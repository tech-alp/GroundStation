# GroundStation

<br>GAZIMODELUYDU_V1.0.m just added for showing the code.</br>
<br>Original file is GaziGroundStation.mlapp but you can't see the code on Githup so I use GAZIMODELUYDU_V1.0.m file for showing code.</br>
When you install the code, you don't open the software because you must fix the images directıry files.
